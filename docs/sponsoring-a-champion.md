#### As a Citizen you may throw the weight of your PUB behind a Champion.

- By throwing your PUB behind them, you give them extra voting power, empowering the Champion to pursue their declared platform.

- Your job as a Citizen is to choose a Champion wisely, pay attention to their decisions and hold them accountable.
