One option available to all Citizens is to ascend to Champion status.

A Champion has declared a platform and has been verified by their peers.

Once you ascend to Champion, you are granted a public profile on the PublicHAUS website and you can begin soliciting Citizens to Sponsor you by delegating their votes to you.

### To become a Champion follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [join.daohaus.fun/#/apply](https://https://join.daohaus.fun/#/apply)
1. Fill out the Verify Champion form including a Proposal Title and Description (These are used to generate a proposal, so that other champions can vote for you.)
1. Under "User Data" add a description of your Champion platform and a link to a resource that would be helpful to Citizens who may want to delegate votes to you.
1. Click "Submit".

Your proposal is now live and will be reviewed by the DAO membership.
