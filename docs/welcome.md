### What is PublicHAUS?

PublicHAUS is the governing framework of the DAOhaus ecosystem and protocol.

### Who is PublicHAUS?

All DAOhaus contributors, supporters and enthusiasts are welcome to join PublicHAUS.

### The Goal is to Build our HAUS¬è

- We use decentralized digital coordination aided by Moloch DAO contracts and the DAOhaus SDK.
- We work together to manage this framework so we can all move toward a decentralized, autonomous future.

### High Level Framework Goals

- **Continued Decentralization** of the DAOhaus Protocol by decreasing the central points of failure - increasing resiliency and diversity.
- **More autonomy** of the individual through collective curation of strategic objectives that empower tactical execution
- **Reduce Complexity** of governance and operational overhead
- **Build and Use** Decentralized Governance Tools and involve the HAUS holder in future direction of the protocol

#### Time to slay Moloch together!
