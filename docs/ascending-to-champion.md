#### One option available to all Citizens is to ascend to Champion status and enter the [Hall of Champions](https://join.daohaus.fun/#/delegates)

- A Champion has declared a platform and has been verified by their peers.

- Once you ascend to Champion, you are granted a public profile on the [PublicHAUS website](https://join.daohaus.fun/#/delegates).

- Any Citizen can [Sponsor a Champion](/docs/sponsoring-a-champion) by delegating their PUB. This gives the Champion increased influence on the direction of the DAOhaus protocol.

### To become a Champion follow these steps:

1. **Navigate** to [join.daohaus.fun/#/apply](https://join.daohaus.fun/#/apply)
1. **Fill Out** the Verify Champion Form by providing your Champion Name, Champion Platform and a link to a resource.

   - **Tip:** _Include anything that would be helpful to Citizens who may want to delegate votes to you._

1. **Click "Submit"**, verify your transaction and wait for the DAO to vote.

#### Your proposal is now live and will be reviewed by the DAO membership.
