As a Citizen you may throw the weight of your PHAUS behind a Champion.

Each Champion has declared their platform, been verified by their peers, and are actively looking for Citizens to represent.

By throwing your PHAUS behind them, you give them extra voting power, empowering the Champion to pursue their declared platform.

Your job as a Citizen is to choose a Champion wisely, pay attention to their decisions and hold them accountable.

### To Sponsor a Champion, follow these steps:

1. Visit the verified Champion list [join.daohaus.fun/#/delegates](join.daohaus.fun/#/delegates)
1. Read the champion platforms by clicking the "See Profile" link next to the Champion listing.
1. Once you've chosen a Champion, go to their profile and click "Delegate".
1. Authorize the transaction.

Congrats! You've chosen a Champion!
