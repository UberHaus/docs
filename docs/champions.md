title: Champions
---

Champions are a special subset of delegates that have publicly declared their ‘platform’, goals and any conflicts of interest. This requires a process of curation and approval from current DAO members. 
Champions are the enablers of the DAO, their role is to help disseminate information and make informed decisions that push execution of the greater DAOs objectives.

Champions are delegates recognized by Public Haus as being:
- A unique human
- Aligned with the DAOhaus manifesto

Champions receive no additional power, but get a public profile of their platform in order to gather delegation from other members.
