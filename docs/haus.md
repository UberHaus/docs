title: HAUS and PUB
---

The HAUS token represents the community of people that are working together to bring a better future with digital decentralized and autonomous organizations. It aligns all DAOs and all people building, experimenting and using the DAOhaus protocol and suite of opensource tools and smart contracts.

The HAUS token’s primary utility is around governance and signaling; deciding the future of the protocol and community's purpose.

The HAUS token is permissionlessly available on multiple chains. Check your favorite DEX agregator. 

As we create more value together, that value flows back to the HAUS token, shared by all communities on the platform

### Onboarding:
To receive governance and signaling rights it requires staking HAUS for PUB in PublicHAUS.
