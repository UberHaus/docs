### Your journey with PublicHAUS begins by becoming a Citizen

All citizens have 2 things in common:

1. They've read and agreed in principle to the [DAOhaus Manifesto](/docs/philosophy-&-vision).
1. They've staked HAUS into the PublicHAUS governance protocol and received PUB.

---

### To become a Citizen, follow these steps:

1. **Acquire** HAUS.
   - If you don't have any or don't know how, head over to the [DAOhaus Discord](https://discord.com/channels/709210493549674598/709834072897093693) and ask about ways to earn or purchase HAUS!
1. **Navigate** to [join.daohaus.fun/#/join](https://join.daohaus.fun/#/join).
1. **Authorize** PublicHAUS to stake HAUS on your behalf.
   - Click the "Approve HAUS" button and confirm the transaction. This will require you to pay a gas fee.
1. **Specify** how much HAUS you'd like to stake

   - check the box indicating you've read the manifesto
   - click "Stake HAUS"

#### Congratulations, you're now a PublicHAUS Citizen and ready to help direct the future of the DAOhaus Protocol!
