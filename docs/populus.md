title: Populus

All PUB or PUB-LOOT holders are part of the DAO populace. They have several actions they can take.

- They can delegate/re-delegate power to a Champion or themselves.
- They can actively participate in the DAO through signaling in meta-governance events. 

The signal captured in these events are used by DAO Champions, members and builders as guiding insight into DAO execution. Even if you have delegated your power you can participate in meta-governance, delegates have the same rights in meta-governance as the general populace and delegated power does not equate to more power in meta-governance
