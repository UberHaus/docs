#### As a Citizen you can throw the weight of your PUB behind High Level Objectives (HILOs).

- HILOs can be created and added by Citizens during Strategic Signaling Sessions. Strategic Signaling Sessions happen every 3 months and last 2 weeks.

- During a Strategic Signaling session, simply fill out the HILO template form and submit it.

- The HILO will be added to the Strategy Board where Citizens and Champions can signal with their PUB if they believe the HILO should be pursued.

### To Create a HILO follow these steps:

1. **Navigate** to the PublicHAUS HILO Signals page [signal.daohaus.fun](https://signal.daohaus.fun/)
1. **Choose** an active Strategic Signalling Session from the list
1. **Click** the Add Choice button at the top of the list and fill out the Create Objective form.

#### Congrats, you've added a High Level Objective!

### To Signal on an existing HILO, follow these steps:

1. **Claim** your shares by pressing the orange Claim button in the top right.
   - This gives you a balance of "PUB Points" equal to your current PUB Balance.
   - PUB Points are used to vote on HILOs
1. **Allocate** your PUB Points to the various HILO by typing values into the appropriate fields.
1. **Authorize** the transaction

> **Tip:** Make sure you are confident in your allocations before you authorize the transaction. You can change your allocations, but you'll have to pay gas again.

#### Congrats, you've helped decide PublicHAUS' direction for the next quarter!
