Hello and Welcome!

Thank you for finding your way to the UberHaus docs.  This documentation will get you setup with everything you need to know to get your DAO initialized in the DAO of DAOs, or *UberHaus* as we'll be referring to it here!

### Who is UberHaus 🏘?

UberHaus is a DAO-of-DAOs — members of UberHaus are all DAOs themselves, and UberHaus believes it's members are in the best position to make decisions about what DAOs need to be successful.

UberHaus DAO is the governing body for the DAOhaus platform, so that it becomes a platform for DAOs, created by DAOs.

### What Purpose does UberHaus Serve 龾?   

UberHaus unites all of the DAOs across the DAOhaus platform.

UberHaus is working to build more tooling, strengthen community and further the adoption of decentralized and digital coordination. 
 

### Where is UberHaus Headed 🙈? 

UberHaus believes DAOs of all types can contribute value, and the main question UberHaus begs that your DAO consider is, What can your DAO do for UberHaus?
 
This question is a core principle to several of the DAOs operating on DAOhaus today, and it serves as guidance to individual contributors of many types, keeping DAOhaus lean and mean in its unified pursuit aimed at defeating Moloch.  
 
UberHaus is committed to upholding the tradition of transparency through actively educating and disseminating information about the processes, discussions, and progress that UberHaus makes through fulfilling its purpose.
