PublicHAUS has a [Discourse forum](https://forum.daohaus.club/) for longer form discussion.

The forum as we mentioned before is the best place to get soft consensus on certain issues. Some but not all are listed below and they are not limited by the following

- objectives
- bids

Please feel free to add a new topic if it has not been added and use this as a place to instigate open discussions regarding Site Improvements, Operations, contentious issues or whatever you see fit.

Please note that the Forum is less active than the Discord, so we encourage anyone making a Forum post to share it within Discord to get more engagement from other Guilders.
